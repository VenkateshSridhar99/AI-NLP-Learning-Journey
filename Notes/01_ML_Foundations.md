# ðŸ§  Machine Learning Foundations (Days 1â€“2)

## What I Really Learned:
I used to think machine learning was this mysterious, elite concept â€” but itâ€™s really just about finding patterns in data.  
No magic, just logic + maths + data.

### Types of Machine Learning:
- **Supervised**: Data with labels. You know the answers, and the model learns to predict them.
- **Unsupervised**: No labels. Let the model group or reduce.
- **Reinforcement**: Like training a dog â€” reward good actions, penalise bad ones.

### Real Terms, Not Jargon:
- **Features** = Inputs (columns in a spreadsheet)
- **Label** = Output you want to predict
- **Model** = A trained pattern recogniser
- **Overfitting** = Memorising instead of understanding
- **Underfitting** = Too simple, doesnâ€™t learn enough

### My Reflection:
Understanding this early saved me from overcomplicating everything. ML is simple ideas scaled smartly.

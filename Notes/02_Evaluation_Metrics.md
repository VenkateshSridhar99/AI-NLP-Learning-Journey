# 📊 Evaluation Metrics (Day 3)

## Why Metrics Matter:
Accuracy is NOT enough. I learned that the hard way with imbalanced data.  
Metrics are how you *trust* your model — not just how well it "feels."

### Key Metrics I Learned:
- **TP / TN / FP / FN** → The backbone of everything
- **Accuracy** = Overall correctness
- **Precision** = Out of predicted positives, how many were right?
- **Recall** = Out of actual positives, how many did we catch?
- **F1 Score** = Balance between precision & recall

### Takeaway:
For real-world tasks like fraud detection or medical diagnosis, **recall or precision > accuracy**.

I now actually ask: “What’s the cost of being wrong?” before picking a metric.

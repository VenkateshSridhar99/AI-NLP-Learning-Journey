# 🧠 Prompt Engineering Basics (Current)

## What It Really Is:
You’re designing inputs for large language models so they give you better outputs.

### Prompt Types I Learned:
- **Zero-shot**: Just ask the question.
- **Few-shot**: Show a few examples → ask the model to continue the pattern.
- **Role Prompting**: “You are a data analyst…” → changes model tone/structure
- **Chain-of-Thought**: Force the model to think step-by-step.
- **Instruction Tuning vs Prompting**: One is during training, one is after.

### My Experience:
Prompt Engineering is less “code” and more **communication + clarity**.
The better I think, the better the model responds.

## Takeaway:
This is the interface layer of AI — the human touchpoint. Knowing ML helps, but clarity is king here.

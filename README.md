\# 🧠 AI-NLP-Learning-Journey



This repository tracks my hands-on learning journey through:

\*\*Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, AI Foundations, and Prompt Engineering.\*\*



\## 📁 Project 1: NLP Text Classification (Starter)



This notebook demonstrates a beginner-friendly text classifier using:



\- 🔤 TF-IDF Vectorisation

\- 🤖 Multinomial Naive Bayes

\- 📊 Evaluation via Accuracy and F1 Score



\### 📄 Dataset

Custom sample dataset with labelled text:

\- Positive reviews (e.g., "I love this product!")

\- Negative reviews (e.g., "Worst experience ever.")



\### 🔧 Techniques Used

\- Text Preprocessing

\- TF-IDF Vectorisation (`TfidfVectorizer`)

\- Naive Bayes Classifier (`MultinomialNB`)

\- Train-Test Split

\- Evaluation Report (`classification\_report`)



\### ✅ Results

\- Accuracy: \*\*100%\*\* on small test sample

\- \*Note: Results will vary with real-world data\*



\## 🚀 What’s Next?

\- ✅ Upload more notebooks

\- ⏭️ Learn and implement \*\*Word Embeddings\*\* (Word2Vec, GloVe)

\- ⏭️ Build real-world projects (Amazon Reviews, Resume Parser, Chatbots)

\- ⏭️ Transition into Transformers (BERT, GPT) + Prompt Engineering



📌 Stay tuned as I build my full portfolio — one project at a time!
